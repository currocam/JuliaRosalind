The graph theoretical analogue of the quandary stated in the introduction above is that if we have an RNA string s that does not have the same number of occurrences of 'C' as 'G' and the same number of occurrences of 'A' as 'U', then the bonding graph of s cannot possibly possess a perfect matching among its basepair edges. For example, see Figure 1; in fact, most bonding graphs will not contain a perfect matching.
  
In light of this fact, we define a maximum matching in a graph as a matching containing as many edges as possible. See Figure 2 for three maximum matchings in graphs.
  
A maximum matching of basepair edges will correspond to a way of forming as many base pairs as possible in an RNA string, as shown in Figure 3.
  
Given: An RNA string s of length at most 100.

Return: The total possible number of maximum matchings of basepair edges in the bonding graph of s.
